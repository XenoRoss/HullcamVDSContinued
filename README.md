Hullcam VDS - A Mechjeb hullcam fork

Hullcam let's you add different cameras(black and white, grainy tv, nightvision, etc) to any part of your vehicle or construction.

Docking ports have special docking cameras now and you can also see through the eyes of your Kerbals in EVA.

Scroll down for a video demonstration of the new filters.

Controls:

Next camera: - (Minus)

Previous camera: = (Equals)

Exits hullcam view: Backspace

Holding down the modifier key (Alt on Windows) while doing the Next/Previous/Exit will change the control point to the new camera

You can change these keys by editing \Gamedata\HullcameraVDS\Plugin\settings.cfg

To view through the eyes of your Kerbal(s):

EVA the Kerbal
Right-click on it
Select "Activate Camera"
Press "Backspace" to deactivate the view.
I suggest doing this in space, as walking around on Kerbin ... well ... the view can be quite dizzying. lol

Also, first person view does work with no problems on a a command chair.

Also, if you right-click and drag while in the view, you can 'look around' a little.

Keep in mind that if you are cycling through all the cameras, then you will cycle through ALL the docking ports in range, not just those on the active vessel.  So if you have a space station with 10 docking ports, you will cycle through all 10.

Please don't forget to delete any previous version before installing the latest one and back up your saved game
